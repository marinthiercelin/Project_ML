# Machine Learning Project on Higgs boson

Using machine learning techniques viewed in class to classify particules

## Recreate the final submission results:

- In a shell go in the directory Project_ML
- Run `python3 run.py`
- The file `submission.csv` will be created in the Project_ML directory

## `cleaner.py`:
Contains all methods that we used or tried to use to clean the data
- fillMissingValuesMeansWithY
- fillMissingValuesMeansWOY
- fillMissingValuesMediansWithY
- fillMissingValuesMediansWOY

## `helpers.py`:
Contains the sub methods that we used in `cleaner.py` and `implementations.py`,

## Use one of the 6 implementations required:

- Create a new file test.py in the root directory
-
